# Simple Quiz DSL Project

## Overview

This project provides a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for creating quizzes and generating an XML representation of them. The generated XML can then be used for integration with Moodle or other platforms.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. **Eclipse IDE** (with Xtext plugin installed)
2. **Docker** (for Moodle instance testing, if applicable)
3. **Java 11 or higher**

### Installing:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the project into Eclipse (use "Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace").
3. Set up the Xtext runtime and all necessary dependencies using `mvn clean install`.
4. Start the Moodle Docker instance (if testing the output).

## How to Use:
1. Open the `QuizDSLStandaloneSetup.java` file in Eclipse.
2. Run it as an Eclipse application.
3. Create or load a `.quiz` file with quiz data (in the defined syntax).
4. The program will generate an XML representation of the quiz.

### Example Input:

quiz "My Test Quiz" {
    question "What is 2 + 2?" calculated {
        expression "2 + 2"
        choice "3" incorrect
        choice "4" correct
    }
    question "WHAT is 2 + 2?" calculated {
        expression "2 + 2"
        choice "1" incorrect
        choice "4" correct
    }
}

### Example Output (XML):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<quiz>
    <randomizeorder>true</randomizeorder>
    <question type="multichoice">
        <name><text>What is 2 + 2?</text></name>
        <questiontext format="html"><text>What is 2 + 2?</text></questiontext>
        <answer fraction="0"><text>3</text></answer>
        <answer fraction="100"><text>4</text></answer>
    </question>
    <question type="multichoice">
        <name><text>WHAT is 2 + 2?</text></name>
        <questiontext format="html"><text>What is 2 + 2?</text></questiontext>
        <answer fraction="0"><text>1</text></answer>
        <answer fraction="100"><text>4</text></answer>
    </question>
</quiz>

Testing:
The system tests if the XML file generated is valid.

It also checks if the quiz contains valid elements like <quiz>, <question>, and <answer>.

Unit tests are written using JUnit and Xtend.




## Testing Summary

### Unit Tests:
1. **Quiz Parsing Test**:
   - Verifies that the `ParseHelper` correctly parses the DSL input.
   - Confirms that the model is not `null` and no errors occurred during parsing.

2. **XML Generation Test**:
   - Verifies that the XML generated by `QuizDSLGenerator` is **not empty**.
   - Checks that it contains key elements like `<quiz>`, `<question>`, and `<answer>`.

### Manual Testing:
- **XML Output**: The XML generated by the system is tested for correctness using external XML validators.
